# Project-GMM-anamoly-detection
Anamoly detection system using Gaussian mixture model as clustering technique
This is implementation of the paper "Active Online Anomaly Detection using Dirichlet Process Mixture Model and Gaussian Process Classification".

File- Full code GMM directly giving motion vectors, is jupyter notebook file.

In cell 11,we have to provide the input path to the video and annotation file(used for labeling the clips).
Video used as input is IDIAP junction dataset(traffic-junction.avi).
Dataset link: https://www.idiap.ch/~odobez/RESSOURCES/DataRelease-TrafficJunction.php

Sample annotation file also provided. (Note: annotation should be in the format provided)
